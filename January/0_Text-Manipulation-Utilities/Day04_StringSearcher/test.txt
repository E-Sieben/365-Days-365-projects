The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
This is a test file for string searching.
It contains multiple lines of text.
Some lines are short, others are long.
We are looking for specific patterns.
Let's see if we can find them all.
This file should be sufficient for testing.
String searching is a useful skill.
It can help you find information quickly.
Regular expressions are very powerful.
They can match complex patterns.
This is line number eleven.
We are getting closer to the end.
Keep searching, you'll find it.
The needle in the haystack.
Another line of text here.
Just adding more content.
To make the file longer.
And more interesting.
Hopefully, this is enough.
Almost there, keep going.
This is line twenty-two.
We need more lines still.
So let's keep writing.
Adding random sentences.
That don't really matter.
But increase the line count.
This is getting tedious.
But we must persevere.
Almost halfway there now.
Just a little bit further.
This is line thirty-one.
Still adding more lines.
To reach our goal of fifty.
It's a long way to go.
But we're making progress.
Keep on typing away.
This is line thirty-seven.
Almost there, I promise.
Just a few more lines.
And we'll be finished.
This is line forty-one.
Getting very close now.
Just a little bit more.
Almost at the finish line.
This is line forty-five.
So close, you can taste it.
Just five more lines to go.
And we're finally done.
This is the last line.
